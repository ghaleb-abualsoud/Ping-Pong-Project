Development Log - Multiplayer Pong Game
Date: November 6, 2025

=== Implementation Process and Issue Resolution Log ===

1. Initial Project Setup
   - Started with provided framework files: pongClient.py, pongServer.py, and helper code
   - Verified requirements.txt containing pygame==2.5.2
   - Project structure includes assets for fonts, sounds, and images

2. Server Implementation
   - Implemented TCP socket-based server with threading support
   - Added proper documentation and type hints following project requirements
   - Implemented game state management (paddle positions, ball location, scores)
   - Added synchronization counter to help keep clients in sync
   - Features:
     * Handles two simultaneous client connections
     * Manages game state updates
     * Coordinates player assignments (left/right paddle)

3. Client Implementation
   - Implemented network communication code
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback
   - Implemented game state synchronization
   - Added documentation and type hints

4. Issues Encountered and Solutions

   Issue 1: Asset Loading Problems
   - Problem: FileNotFoundError when trying to load fonts and assets
   - Root Cause: Relative paths weren't working when running from project root
   - Solution: 
     * Added SCRIPT_DIR constant to get the script's directory
     * Updated asset paths to use os.path.join with absolute paths
     * Modified README to instruct running from correct directory

   Issue 2: Network Connection Error
   - Problem: Socket not connected error when starting client
   - Root Cause: Debug code bypassing proper connection flow
   - Solution:
     * Removed debug code that started game directly
     * Restored proper connection flow through startScreen()
     * Updated documentation for correct startup procedure

   Issue 3: Graphics Trailing Issue
   - Problem: Ball and paddles leaving visual trails during movement
   - Root Cause: Partial screen updates not clearing previous positions
   - Solution:
     * Replaced pygame.display.update with pygame.display.flip()
     * Ensures complete screen refresh each frame
     * Eliminated trailing graphics without performance impact

5. Final Implementation Features
   - Clean client-server communication
   - Proper game state synchronization
   - Smooth gameplay with proper graphics
   - Complete error handling
   - Well-documented code following project requirements

6. Project Structure
   - pongServer.py: Server implementation with threading
   - pongClient.py: Client implementation with pygame interface
   - assets/: Game resources (fonts, sounds, images)
   - requirements.txt: Dependencies
   - README.md: Setup and running instructions

7. Running the Game
   - Server starts on port 12345
   - Clients connect via IP address
   - Supports local and network play
   - Uses TCP for reliable communication

8. Documentation
   - Added detailed README.md
   - Included proper code documentation
   - Added type hints throughout the code
   - Created troubleshooting guide

9. Current Limitations and Potential Improvements
   - Limited to exactly two players
   - No reconnection mechanism
   - Server requires restart for new games
   - Potential future improvements:
     * Support for multiple games
     * Reconnection handling
     * Web-based leaderboard
     * Player authentication

=== Project Status ===
The project is now fully functional with all basic requirements implemented and major issues resolved. The code is well-documented and follows the specified coding style guidelines. The game is playable over a network with proper synchronization between clients.
